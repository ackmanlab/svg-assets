## What is svg?

[Scalable Vector Graphics (svg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics) is an open W3C standard for 2D vector graphics exchange over the world wide web. It is just a markup (xml) specification. svg files can be created, opened, and edited with any **plain text editor**. svg content can also be created with many open source or proprietary interactive graphics programs and can be viewed with any web browser. In the context of a web application, svg can be styled with css and scripted/animated with JavaScript.


## Notes

The type of svg graphics added to this git repo should primarily be a mix of simple line drawings, shading, and text. *Usage of raster/image data should be minimized.* Though svg files can contain images-- either as embedded data or as a hypertext link to remote url-- embedded images get encoded as a [base64 data format](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/Data_URIs) in svg graphics files. Base64 is a highly portable, but less efficient (e.g wasteful) way of storing real image data compared with raster formats like png/jpeg). Thus if the desired content does not require too many individual objects, it should just be composed as a vector graphic.

Graphics from here can then be openly patched into more complex figure/svg graphics for other projects.

All are welcome to contribute. The free and open source [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org) drawing program is highly recommended for creating or editing svg graphics figures. Libreoffice has some nice diagramming tools as well. Graphviz (dot language) is good for diagrams of networks.

<!-- Recommended workflow is to clone this repo locally, then make a working branch for yourself separate from the master branch while working on collaborative changes or adding new content. Then merge the changes with master. -->

### Network diagrams

With the open source graph visualization software [GraphViz](http://www.graphviz.org/) locally installed, the plain text `.dot` files can be edited and then rendered with a command like this:  

`dot ppc-circuits.dot -Tsvg -o ppc-circuits.svg`

Fig caption test with html img style links:

<Paste>


html style img links `<img src="filename">` with or without absolute urls doesn't work with this git server rendering app:  

<img src="fig_motor-neuron-key.png" width="300px">

md style links `![](filename)` work with pngs but not svgs with this system:
